# SmsServer

This is small Xamarin App on Android running SMS Server in FSharp with Suave

I use it to transform my old Android smartphones to SMS API endpoints for domotic and robotic personal projects.

## Getting started

- You can connect your phone to your private WIFI network
- Run the app
- Tap on "Start server" button
- Go to the swagger API documentation
